<h1>Harmonic Mean Calculation</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The harmonic mean is a type of average that is used to calculate the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of a set of numbers. It is particularly useful when dealing with rates or ratios. This program takes an array of integers as input and calculates the harmonic mean of the numbers in the array.</p>

   <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
   <p>To run this program, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.</p>

   <h2>How to Run</h2>
   <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository or download the <code>Main.java</code> file.</li>
        <li>Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the <code>Main.java</code> file is located.</li>
        <li>Compile the Java file by running the following command:<br>
            <code>javac Main.java</code>
        </li>
        <li>After successful compilation, run the program using the following command:<br>
            <code>java Main</code>
        </li>
        <li>The program will calculate the harmonic mean of the numbers in the provided list and display the result.</li>
    </ol>

   <h2>Usage</h2>
   <p>Modify the <code>list</code> array in the <code>main</code> method of the <code>Main.java</code> file to include the numbers for which you want to calculate the harmonic mean. The program will automatically calculate the harmonic mean for the given list and display the result on the console.</p>
    
   <pre><code>int[] list = {15, 6, 8, 12, 7, 9, 3};</code></pre>

   <h2>Example Output</h2>
   <p>Running the program with the provided list [15, 6, 8, 12, 7, 9, 3] will produce the following output:</p>
   <pre><code>Harmonic mean: 6.802930967990745</code></pre>
